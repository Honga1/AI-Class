## Download
To download the code, press the green button in the top right corner that says "Clone or download" and select "Download ZIP". The files you'll need will be in the folder "ga_assignment". It's a processing program, so that should be familliar! If you want to take a look at the slides of the presentation again, they are also in the ZIP folder you just downloaded.

## Lab
For the lab part of this presentation you are going to be programming your own genetic algorithm! Don't be intimidated, we've prepared some things for you. You'll just need to fill in some TODO's that are left open in the code. We'll explain these individual ones more in depth below this paragraph. There is also an explaination of each individual processing file in the folder at the end of this readme.
